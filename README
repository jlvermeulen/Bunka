Welcome to the Bunka git repository! This is our main repository for the development of Bunka, a city/civilisation building simulator. More information will follow later.

We currently have:

- Resources classes, which represent an amount of a resource at a specific place
- Carriers for moving resources around
- Building that produce or convert resources
- Builders that construct buildings
